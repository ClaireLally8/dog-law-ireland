Key proposals include strengthening dog breeding laws, regulating fertility clinics, improving microchipping and licensing systems, and establishing an independent regulator. The pledge also calls for a ban on greyhound racing, better funding for animal welfare organisations, and tougher penalties for animal cruelty. </p><p>Dog Law Ireland published a list of signatories before the general election commenced to assist voters in deciding who to vote for.</p>",
