                <p>We cannot change what we don’t understand... so we want to make dog law accessible and easily understood
                    by everyone - the general public, animal rescues, An Garda Siochana, the Government, the veterinarian
                    community, the legal profession &amp; all those working in the canine industry. <br><br> While we are small in number, we are determined to make a change. We are also very fortunate to have
                    developed so many wonderful relationships with those who have been at the forefront of advocating for Ireland’s
                    dogs long before Dog Law Ireland became Dog Law Ireland. We also have some wonderful people volunteering their time to help us &amp; we are always open to hearing
                    from people who would like to help (in particular legal researchers!) so please do get in touch if you would like to get involved.
